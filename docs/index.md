    &emsp;&emsp;PyORlib is a powerful Python library for operations research and optimization. It provides a set of 
	abstractions to easily define, solve, and interact with mathematical models in a standardized manner across 
	different optimization packages. With PyORlib, you can easily implement mathematical models using a user-friendly 
	interface, while seamlessly identifying the ideal solver or optimization package, such as CPLEX, Gurobi, 
	OR-Tools, or PuLP, that perfectly aligns with your specific requirements.
</p>

## Key Features

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
	PyORlib offers a powerful yet easy-to-use set of tools for mathematical modeling and optimization:
</p> 

<ul style='text-align: justify;'>

<li><b>Intuitive API</b> ─ 
PyORlib provides a user-friendly API that allows you to define, solve, and interact with mathematical models in a 
standardized manner across different optimization packages.
</li>

<li><b>Seamless Solver Integration</b> ─ 
Optimize models across different solvers, including custom ones, without modifying the model's definition. Tailor the 
behavior and capabilities of the solvers to perfectly align with your unique requirements.
</li>

<li><b>Simplified Mathematical Modeling</b> ─ 
Define mathematical models effortlessly using PyORlib's comprehensive set of abstractions and classes. Focus on the 
problem at hand instead of getting lost in implementation details.
</li>

<li><b>Scalability and Maintainability</b> ─ 
Keep your code organized, readable, and maintainable over time with the PyORlib's workflow. Structure your variables,
parameters, constraints, and objective functions in a clean and extensible manner.
</li>

<li><b>No Overhead</b> ─ 
PyORlib ensures full compatibility between models and different solvers by seamlessly translating models to each 
solver's native format, acting as a standardized communication interface.
</li>

<li><b>Data Validation</b> ─ 
PyORlib offers comprehensive format and content validations to ensure the integrity of your model data. These 
validation features help identify errors early and maintain consistent, error-free model data for robust optimization.
</li>

<li><b>Comprehensive Documentation</b> ─ 
PyORlib provides a comprehensive documentation suite that includes API references and usage examples, to effectively
leverage all the features and capabilities of the library.
</li>

</ul>
