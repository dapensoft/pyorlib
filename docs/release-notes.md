<hr class="divider">

##### Initial Implementation

&emsp;&emsp;This release introduces the initial version of PyORlib, a powerful Python library for operations research
and optimization. PyORlib provides a set of abstractions to easily define, solve, and interact with mathematical models
in a standardized manner across different optimization packages. It serves as a user-friendly and powerful platform for
students, researchers, and practitioners to explore optimization concepts, experiment with algorithms, and expand their
knowledge.

- **Implementation Details:** The first implementation includes all the core functionalities of the package,
  encompassing built-in optimization package integrations, algebraic modeling, validators, and more.
- **Testing and Coverage:** This release includes a test suite that verifies the correctness of the package
  implementation. It also integrates code coverage, achieving 100% test coverage. The tests are configured to run
  automatically via GitHub Actions on both push and pull requests to the master branch.
- **Formatter and Lint Configuration:** A formatter and lint configuration have been added to the project. This ensures
  consistent code style, maintainability, and adherence to the established coding standards defined in the project
  documentation.
- **Documentation:** Additionally, this release includes comprehensive documentation for the package. The documentation
  covers the main page, a detailed getting started guide, examples, API reference, and release notes.
